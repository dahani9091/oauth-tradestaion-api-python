# oauth-tradestaion-api-python
This is a fork of an unofficial client library of tradestation api https://github.com/areed1192/tradestation-python-api. <br>
I've handeled in this repo the redirect_uri to be created automatically. So it would be easy for you to get authenticated. no need to create an http server to handle the callback.

Cheers!
