# oauth-tradestaion-api-python
This is a fork of an unofficial client library of tradestation api https://github.com/areed1192/tradestation-python-api.
I've handeled is this repo the redirect_uri automatically. so it would be easy for you to get authenticated. no need to create an http server to handle the callback.
